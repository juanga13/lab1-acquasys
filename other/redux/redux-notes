Redux 3 principles:
1) single source of truth --> single state and single store has everything i want.
2) state is read-only --> state should not be mutable (we need to use actions).
3) Changes are made with pure functions --> take the state and return the NEXT state (new
                                            state, not changing the previous one).
Store --> orchestrates all the things that happends in redux.
Reducers --> they give use the next state we wont, taking two parameters (state and action).
Actions --> type and what they do.
